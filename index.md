### Intro
I am a social entrepreneur focused on providing informed, comprehensive research analysis and data services to underserved communities. I help foundations, non-profits, and consultancies to access, curate, and analyze internal and secondary data to understand socioeconomic trends, support strategic goals, and increase stakeholder engagement.<br><br/>

My passion is to empower the public with sustainable processes, information, and tools they need to achieve their vision.
